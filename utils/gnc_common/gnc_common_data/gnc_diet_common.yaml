Add the pasta and cook until al dente (tender), 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the package directions. Drain the pasta thoroughly. In a nonstick frying pan over medium heat, add the reserved juice from the canned tomatoes. Stir in the carrots, broccoli and green pepper. Saute the vegetables until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil, oregano and black pepper to the vegetable mixture. Cook over low heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked vegetables to a large bowl. Add the cooked pasta and shredded mozzarella cheese. Toss gently to mix. Spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the grated Parmesan cheese. Cover with aluminum foil and bake until the mixture is hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil after 15 minutes. Divide the pasta among warmed individual bowls. Serve immediately.",
            "tip": "For an alternative to spaghetti with meat sauce, try baked ziti, a tubular-shaped pasta dish, loaded with fresh vegetables. Serve with mixed-grain bread and a side of sliced strawberries and bananas. May also serve with other side dish of your taste.",
